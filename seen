# moves the seen-episodes-marker by one. Start by naming this file seen1 (or "seen0" if nothing was seen yet ^^)
# can also be put in your PATH to handle initial move automatically.
#
# "seen --all" will set the marker to read "seenAll", which is usefull after finishing the episodes.
# "seen --open" or "seen o" can be used to automatically start the next episode and advance the pointer if it has been
# 		watched for a given time (see settings)

# sidenote: if seenAll existis it is ignored as you might be rewatching, and then it's handy to have it 
# 			 ignored but kept around as marker (I like it that way YMMV XD )



# settings -----
LIMIT=300   # max no of episodes. More = slightly slower.
PLAYER="smplayer"   #player to use. Should be blocking, otherwise "--open" can not work properly. use wrappers if needed.
SECONDS_TO_ASSUME_SEEN=240 #==4min ; if player is opened less than this time no automatic advance of seen will be done (so you can have a short look into episodes)
